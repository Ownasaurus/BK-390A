Windows version:
- Autodetect serial port for the meter

- Autoscale the window to suit the maximum required size of the 
	readout based on the font size.

- Fill the canvas background with the right colour rather than 
	relying purely on the text background to provide the coverage

- Add stroked outline to text so that it can be used in OBS
	with a chromakey and not look too awful
